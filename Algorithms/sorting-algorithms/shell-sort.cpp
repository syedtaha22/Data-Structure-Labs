/*
    Shell Sort:
    - Shell Sort is an optimization of Insertion Sort.
    - It starts by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other,
     then progressively reducing the gap between elements to be compared.
    - The final pass of Shell Sort is a regular Insertion Sort.

    Time Complexity:
    - Best Case: O(n log n) - When the array is already sorted.
    - Average Case: ? - Depends on the gap sequence used.
    - Worst Case: O(n^2) - When the gap sequence is 1.

    Space Complexity: O(1)
    In-Place: Yes
    Stable: No
